<p><img src="images/Screenshot%202025-02-23%20224445.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The data sets I chose contain details about crashes reported in Montgomery County. The first data set has over 100,000 entries with 39 columns, including both categorical and numerical variables. The second data set is similar but focuses only on non-motorists. I included non-motorists because, while drivers face risks, pedestrians and cyclists are also exposed to accidents. To better understand these two data sets, I decided to combine them. This combined data set will help answer key questions for my project.</p>
