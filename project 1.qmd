## Introduction:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-02-23%20224445.png)

The data sets I chose contain details about crashes reported in Montgomery County. The first data set has over 100,000 entries with 39 columns, including both categorical and numerical variables. The second data set is similar but focuses only on non-motorists. I included non-motorists because, while drivers face risks, pedestrians and cyclists are also exposed to accidents. To better understand these two data sets, I decided to combine them. This combined data set will help answer key questions for my project.

## load the libraries and data sets 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
crash_rep <- read.csv("C:/Users/satad/Downloads/Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data_20250318.csv")
non_motorists <- read.csv("C:/Users/satad/Downloads/Crash_Reporting_-_Non-Motorists_Data_20250318 (1).csv")
```

**I will start by modifying the name of the column to make my work more easier**.

```{r}
colnames(crash_rep)
colnames(non_motorists)

```

### Perform an inner join to combine the datasets on "Report.Number"

```{r}
combined_data <- inner_join(crash_rep, non_motorists, by = "Report.Number")
View(combined_data)
```

## Install packages, and load libraries

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("stats")

# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stats)

```
