 data-205 project
   This project was completed as part of my studies as a Data Science student at Montgomery College, with the goal of analyzing traffic crash data in Montgomery County, Maryland to uncover key factors contributing to accidents and injury severity. Using two popular datasets from Data Montgomery, one for crashes involving drivers and another for non-motorists such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and scooters. I conducted a thorough data cleaning and exploration process. I standardized variables, created new features, and used a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, heatmaps, and bubble plots, to reveal patterns related to weather, lighting, road types, speed limits, vehicle makes, and substance use. I also performed statistical analyses like mean, median, and odds ratio calculations to better understand relationships between variables and crash outcomes. The tools used included RStudio, Quarto, and R packages like tidyverse, plotly, ggplot2.. You are welcome to take a look at this project, explore the insights, and share it with others who might be interested in promoting road safety and data-driven solutions.
